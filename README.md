The operational amplifier also known as Op-Amp is one of the most valuable devices in the market now; as for its ability to perform so many different operations when it’s combined with other devices like Capacitor, hence it’s called an operational amplifier. it’s used excessively in analog circuits, especially when it’s combined with a capacitor, it can work as Integrator, and so many other mathematical operations like Differentiation, subtraction, and addition. </br>
This report will focus on the analysis of some circuits containing Op-Amp, and show through results, how important this device is.
